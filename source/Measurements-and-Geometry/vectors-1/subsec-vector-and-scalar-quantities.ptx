        In our daily lives, we measure many things using just a single number, such as the temperature of a room or the mass of an object. 
        However, for some physical quantities, knowing <q>how much</q> is not enough; we also need to know <q>which way</q>. 
        For example, knowing a hospital is <m>5</m> km away is not helpful unless you also know the direction to travel. 
        This section explores the key differences between quantities that only have <alert>magnitude</alert> and those that have both <alert>magnitude</alert> and <alert>direction</alert>.

                Consider the following situations at a school sports day:
                <ol marker="a)">
                    <li>A sprinter runs 100 meters in the 100 m race</li>
                    <li>A discus thrower hurls the discus 60 meters north</li>
                    <li>A participant's body temperature is 37°C</li>

                Let's analyze each situation:

                        <p>
                            <alert>Scalar quantity</alert> - The 100 meters tells us only the distance covered, not the direction of travel. Even though we know it's a race on a track, distance alone is a scalar.

                        <p>
                            <alert>Vector quantity</alert> - The displacement "60 meters north" includes both magnitude (60 meters) and direction (north), making it a vector.

                            <alert>Scalar quantity</alert> - Temperature has no direction. It's just a measure of how hot or cold something is, so it's purely a scalar.

                            <alert>Vector quantity</alert> - Force has both magnitude and direction (upward in this case), so it's a vector.

                            <strong>Key difference:</strong> Speed is a scalar quantity (magnitude only), while velocity is a vector quantity (magnitude and direction). This distinction is important in physics and mathematics.
